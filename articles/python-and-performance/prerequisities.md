<!-- Short description:

In this article, we discuss what you need to know beforehand in order to  be 
able to grasp the contents, as well as how the course is structured

In order to succeed in this course, you need to know few things beforehand.

Generally, this course is aimed for people who already know how the program
with Python, i.e. we won't be teaching Python programming as such. However,
you do not need to be an expert in Python programming. Most importantly, you
should be familiar with:

- Python syntax
- Basic built-in datastructures (lists, tuples and dictionaries)
- Control structures (if-else, while, for)
- How to write and use functions and modules
- File I/O

You can test your prerequisite information by trying the complete the simple
assignments at:

Previous knowledge of high-performance computing is not need, we discuss
the relevant topics as we proceed. However, if you are interested in learning
more about high-performance computing in general, we recommend the FutureLearn
course [Supercomputing](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/supercomputing).

The course duration is four weeks, and in each week we discuss a different
topic related to Python performance. The presentations are done in articles and
videos, which are followed by hands-on exercises related to the particular 
topic. Roughly half of the time is devoted to exercises, doing things yourself 
and getting your hands dirty is always the best way to learn programming.
We provide simple instructions for setting up a programming environment for
the course in your own laptop/workstation, but we provide also some guidance
on installing the various Python components in a supercomputing cluster.
