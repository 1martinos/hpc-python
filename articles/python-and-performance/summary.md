We hope that you have enjoyed the first week of Python in High Performance 
Computing!

During this week, we have discussed various performance challenges in Python
programs, as well as set up the programming environment for the course. We
have also introduced various ways of investigating the performance of Python
programs. We hope that you remember the number one rule in performance 
optimization:

> Measure before you optimize!

By now, you should know how to use the `cProfile` profiling tool which is
included in the Python standard library.
