<!-- Title: Prerequisities and structure of the course -->

<!-- Short description:

In this article, we discuss what you need to know beforehand in order to fully
benefit from the course and explain how the course is structured.

In order to succeed in this course, you need to know few things beforehand.

First, this course is aimed at people who already know how to program in
Python. **We will not be teaching Python programming as such.** However,
that said, you do not need to be an expert in Python programming either.

We expect you to be familiar (and comfortable) with:

- Python syntax
- Basic built-in datastructures (lists, tuples and dictionaries)
- Control structures (if-else, while, for)
- How to write and use functions and modules
- File I/O

You can test if you have the prerequisite level of skills and knowledge by
going through the quiz in the next step.

Second, previous knowledge of high-performance computing is not needed, we
will discuss the relevant topics as we proceed. However, if you are interested
in learning more about high-performance computing in general, we recommend the
upcoming PRACE online course on
[Supercomputing](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/supercomputing).

Third, the course duration is four weeks. Each week we discuss a different
topic related to Python performance. The main aspects of each topic is covered
in articles and videos, but most importantly, these are followed by hands-on
exercises on the topic. At least half of your time should be devoted to the
exercises, since getting your hands dirty and doing it yourself is simply the
best way to learn programming.

We provide simple instructions for setting up a programming environment for
the course in your own laptop/workstation, but we provide also some guidance
on installing the various Python components in a supercomputing cluster.
