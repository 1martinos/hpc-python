<!-- Title: Week 3 summary -->

<!-- Short description:

In this article we summarize the week three.

-->

We hope that you have enjoyed the third week of Python in High Performance
Computing!

During this week, we have discussed Cython, optimising static compiler for
Python. By adding static type definitions into existing Python module (using
Cython extension language) one can in best cases obtain over hundred-fold
speed-ups.

In the latter part of the week we discussed how existing libraries (with C
interface) or existing C and Fortran code can be interfaced with different
Python tools.

By now, you should know how to transfer dynamic Python code into a more static
compiled code with the help of Cython, as well as how to utilize C or Fortran
code from Python.
