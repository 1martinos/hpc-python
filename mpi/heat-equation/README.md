## Parallel heat equation

Parallelize the [heat equation program](../../numpy/heat-equation) with MPI,
by dividing the grid in blocks of rows and assigning one row block to one
task. A domain decomposition, that is.

The tasks are able to update the grid independently everywhere else than on
the boundary rows â€“ there the communication of a single row with the nearest
neighbor is needed. This is realized by having additional ghost layers that
contain the boundary data of the neighboring tasks. As the system is
aperiodic, the outermost ranks communicate with a single neighbor, and the
inner ranks with two neighbors.

Insert the proper MPI routines into the skeleton code in
[skeleton.py](skeleton.py) (search for "TODO"s).
Remember to update all ghost layers at each iteration.

A schematic representation of the decomposition looks like
