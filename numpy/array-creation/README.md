## Array creation

Start from a Python list containing both integers and floating point values,
and construct then a NumPy array from the list.

Generate a 1D NumPy array containing all numbers from -2.0 to 2.0 with a
spacing of 0.2. Use optional start and step arguments of the `np.arange()`
function.

Generate another 1D NumPy array containing 11 equally spaced values between
0.5 and 1.5. Extract every second element of the array.
