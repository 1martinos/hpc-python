## Split and combine arrays

Continue with the 4x4 array created in the [Array slicing](../array-slicing)
exercise.

1. Use `np.split()` function for splitting the array into two new 2x4 arrays.
   Reconstruct the original 4x4 array by using `np.concatenate()`.
2. Repeat the above exercise but create now 4x2 subarrays and then combine
   them.
